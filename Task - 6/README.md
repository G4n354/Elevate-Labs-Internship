# Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## Objective: 
Understand and implement KNN for classification problems.

## Tools Used: 
### Python >
> Scikit-learn

> Pandas

> Matplotlib

## Steps to Perform:
1.Choose a classification dataset and normalize features.

2.Use KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.

3.Experiment with different values of K.

4.Evaluate model using accuracy, confusion matrix.

5.Visualize decision boundaries.

## Skills Learned:
> Instance-based learning

> Euclidean distance

> K selection.
